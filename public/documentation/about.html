    <h1>About Chamilo</h1>

    <h2>The Chamilo Project</h2>

    The Chamilo project is the combined entities of the Chamilo Software, the Chamilo Community and the Chamilo Association.
    The project pursues the goal of "Increasing the availability of quality education worldwide" since 2010.

    <h2>The Chamilo Software</h2>

    <p>Chamilo is an e-learning and course management web application, a free software under the <a href="license.html">GNU/GPLv3+ license</a>.
        It's translated into more 30 languages, SCORM 1.2 compatible, light and flexible.</p>

    <p>Chamilo supports many different kinds of learning and collaboration activities.
        Teachers/trainers can create, manage and publish their courses through the web.
        Students/trainees can follow courses, read content, take exams and participate actively
        through groups, forums, chat.
        Administrators provide support to trainers and trainee.</p>


    <p>Technically speaking, Chamilo is a web application written in PHP that stores data in a MariaDB/MySQL database.
        Users access it using a web browser.<br>
        The first stable version of Chamilo, 1.8.6.2 Salto (early 2010), was based on the Dokeos(TM) 1.8.6.1
        code. Dokeos(TM) was itself forked from the Claroline (first published in 2001) project in late 2003.<br>
        Chamilo has progressed considerably since its early days, and cannot be, for most purposes, compared to
        Dokeos(TM) and Claroline in any reasonable way, but it is important to mention those ancestors as we recognized
        their historical significance and it means Chamilo was technically born in 2001, as a fork is a continuation of
        the previous project, albeit with different ideals.
    </p>


    <p>If you would like to know more or help develop this software, please visit
        our homepage at <a href="https://chamilo.org">https://chamilo.org</a>
    </p>

    <h2>The Chamilo Community</h2>

    <p>The Chamilo community engulfs the users, translators, designers, thinkers and developers who have contributed
        something to the Chamilo project (we count them as "contributors") and the people who have used our software,
        have learnt from anything that were taught through it or by it, have shared or lived experiences thanks to the
        Chamilo software or the rest of the Chamilo community.
    </p>

    <h2>The Chamilo Association</h2>

    <p>Chamilo is also an association under Spanish law, backed up by a network of private partners to coordinate
        efforts/contributions around Chamilo and promote its availability as a Free Software in the sense of its
        Free Software licence. Private partners, or providers, assist companies and institutions in their e-learning
        projects for a fee, with which they contribute to the Chamilo project in a number of ways.
        This network also promotes professional versions of Chamilo solutions, which
        consist of complete packages of services based on Chamilo (see https://chamilo.org/providers for more details)</p>

    <h1>Features</h1>

    This is a non-exhaustive list of features. Chamilo contains hundreds of thousands of lines of code, split into many
    tools and options provided to the final user, so an exhaustive list has never really be compiled.

    <h1>SCORM</h1>
    Chamilo imports and manages SCORM 1.2 contents.<br />
    For more information on SCORM normalisation, see <a href="https://adlnet.gov">https://adlnet.gov</a><br />
    Chamilo does not implement the full set of SCORM 1.2 specifications, as many are not mandatory.
    Check our website for more details.<br />

    <hr>

    <h1>Portability</h1>
    <p>Chamilo is an "AMP" software. This means it should work on any platform running Apache<br />
        + MySQL + PHP. It is thus supposed to work on the following Operating Systems, given the proper software stack support:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> Linux</li>
        <li> Windows (98, Me, NT4, 2000, XP, VISTA)</li>
        <li> Unix</li>
        <li> Mac OS X</li>
    </ul>

    We officially recommend using Debian and Ubuntu operating systems for their security, packaging system, community and
    availability to the public.<br />

    <hr>

    <h1>Interoperability</h1>

    <p>Chamilo imports SCORM 1.2 compliant learning contents. It imports "On the shelve"
        contents from many companies and custom content developed through authoring tools exporting to SCORM 1.2.</p>

    <p>Admins can imports users through CSV, XML or deeper integrations with HR or administrative systems through REST webservices</p>

    <p>Chamilo includes authentication features that allow admins to disable database authentication and replace it by connecting to a LDAP, OKTA, AD or OAuth2.0 federated accounts management systems.</p>

    <p>Client side, Chamilo runs on any browser : Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Safari, Opera, ...<br />
        For a better user experience, we recommend Firefox (you can download it
        freely from <a href="https://getfirefox.com">http://getfirefox.com</a>).</p>
